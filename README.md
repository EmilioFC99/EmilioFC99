# Hi there, I'm Emilio 👋

I'm an Analytics Engineer at **Bettercloud**, specializing in designing and implementing scalable data solutions using **Google Cloud Platform**. I'm passionate about building robust data infrastructure, optimizing performance, and automating complex workflows to drive business insights.

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools

* **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **Data Warehousing:** BigQuery
* **ETL/ELT & Orchestration:** Dataflow, Dataform, Composer (Airflow), Python
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (GKE)
* **Programming:** Python

### Experience Highlights

Here's a summary of what I do and have done:

#### 🏛️ Data Architecture & Modeling
- Designed and implemented a **Medallion architecture** for our data warehouse, separating raw, curated, and presentation layers to improve data quality and usability.
- Re-architected data models to eliminate redundancy and normalize schemas, directly contributing to query performance and cost reduction.
- Documented data lineage and business logic using Dataform and Dataplex, creating a single source of truth for our data assets.

#### ⚡ Performance Optimization
- Specialized in **BigQuery query optimization**, achieving up to **80% reduction in execution time** and **60% reduction in cost** by refactoring queries, implementing table partitioning, clustering, and optimizing data structures.
- Utilized **Dataflow** to handle pre-processing of large, nested JSON data from `.parquet` files, offloading heavy transformations that are inefficient for BigQuery to handle.

#### 🌊 ETL/ELT Pipeline Development
- Migrated legacy Python-based ETL processes to modern, declarative workflows in **Dataform**.
- Built and maintained both **batch** (MySQL) and **streaming** (Kafka) ingestion pipelines using **Dataflow**.
- Orchestrated complex, multi-system workflows with **Composer (Airflow)**, automating everything from data ingestion (databases, API and spreadsheets) and transformation to loading data into Salesforce, BigQuery, GCS, S3, Google Drive and Spreadsheets, and sending custom client reports.

#### 🏗️ Infrastructure & Automation
- Leveraged **Terraform** to manage GCP resources as code, including service accounts, BigQuery datasets, custom IAM roles, and secrets.
- Packaged Python applications into **Docker** containers and deployed them on Kubernetes for scheduled jobs and DAG tasks.
- Created a small API with **Cloud Run** to trigger Composer DAGs programmatically.
